description: '"This novel tells of the struggles and sufferings of Catholic Recusants
  under Queen Elizabeth I of England. One such Recusant, Robin Audrey, is shocked
  to learn his father had decided to leave the Catholic Church for the safety of the
  Church of England. The narrative follows Robin''s struggle with the call of faith,
  as he is torn between his dream of marriage and a priestly vocation, which would
  entail further persecution and might even end in martyrdom"--Back cover.'
